# hybridPi
An MPI+openMP Pi Calculator

This is simple code that I used to demonstrate how to use Slurm one our cluster at Pitt for hybrid codes.

This code computes pi by numerical integration of arctan(1). See link to slides.
The numerical integration can parallelized over OpenMP and/or MPI.

See the shell script for example invocations.
